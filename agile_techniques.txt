Homework: Lesson 10 – Agile Techniques

###Question 1- definitions for Scrum related key terminology.
#SCRUM CEREMONIES
• Product backlog refinement- this process is typically undertaken by the product owner and development team to adapt the product backlog (perhaps through adding or removing items)
and the contents of the items (e.g., through adding details or segmenting items)- this ongoing interaction helps assert the clarity and scope for the items to be worked upon.

• Sprint planning- This is a scrum team’s collaborative process of essentially laying out the framework/sprint backlog for the upcoming sprint, including:
the clarification of the goals and value of sprint, discussing the scope of the sprint through selecting items from the product backlog, and clarifying how the work will be segmented into smaller items and tackled to achieve the goals.

• Daily scrum- this is a daily scheduled, short meeting (approx. 15 mins) that is held between developers to assess the team's progress towards meeting the goals of the sprint and ensure everyone is updated regarding the next steps.

• Sprint review- this involves a meeting held at the end of a sprint between the developers, the product owner, scrum master, and stakeholders which typically consists of the following actions:
presenting a demo showcasing the scrum team’s accomplishments and setbacks to stakeholders against the previously clarified goals;
acquiring feedback from stakeholders (providing insight regarding customer expectations);
a collaborative effort to discuss the next steps based upon a review of timelines, budgets, markets etc.

• Sprint retrospective- this process takes place after the completion of a sprint and involves the scrum team analysing and discussing their methods of working throughout the sprint;
this may result in a discussion regarding what went well, what did not go as well, and what can be done to improve these fallbacks to better prepare the team for a future sprint.

#SCRUM ROLES
• ScrumMaster- The scrum master enacts the scrum framework/guidelines, which are based upon agile principles, to guarantee the effectiveness and productivity of a scrum. This includes the following responsibilities:
facilitating communications between the team and with external stakeholders through arranging meetings that are conducted within a given timebox (incl. daily scrums, sprint reviews); removing barriers to progress;
facilitating collaboration with stakeholders;
providing guidance regarding the managing of product backlog and the defining of product goals and items.

• Product Owner- The product owner is the most explicit link between the scrum team and the customer/stakeholders. In representing their customers, they are responsible for ensuring a valuable product is produced on time through managing the product backlog
(i.e., clarifying the product goal and the product backlog items, ordering these items, and ensuring these steps are understood and achievable).

• Development Team- The development team are those within the scrum team who are responsible for building the product as laid out in the sprint goals, including the designing, integrating, and testing of items.
They are actively involved in every ceremony to assess the team's progress, determine the next steps and gain clarity regarding their responsibilities throughout a sprint.

###Question 2
Description of new yoga booking system:
• It has a very simple interface to accept user input (bookings) and display classes information
• All bookings, appointments, schedule etc should be stored in a SQL database.
• There is ‘backend’ system that should be written in Python to handle the logic and manage
the data flow.
- two weeks to build a simple prototype that will be shown to the client to seek their feedback and discuss further enhancements.

Overview of scripts to be made:
- sql script- creating the database which will contain the classes, booking slots and days (availability)
- main script- booking interface asking the users for the contact info (initial registration or log in), the class they wish to sign up for, confirming their booking
- app script- containing the get request for availability and put requests for booking and client info.
- connection script- retrieving booking data from the DB and updating the booking data when a user confirms it.

Splitting the tasks into units or smaller stories:
- Prior to the other actions, the database must first be designed in SQL with at least a few fields and entries
to allow for testing of functionality. This may be populated further as the backend and user interface tasks are underway.
The creation of the separate tables required could be achieved in parallel as the developers work on inputting the information regarding the clients and the classes into their respective tables.

- The next step would be to handle the backend system which will allow for interaction with the SQL database.
This may be split with a program having the purpose of retrieving the availability data in order to find the yoga class slots and showcase them in the user interface to be created.
The other story would consider the need to put info into the database when a new booking has been created and a clients info has been input.

- Tasks regarding the user interface may be worked upon in parallel.
This could be split to tackle the priorities which would be to showcase the classes and mark the available slots
before asking a user to select and confirm the yoga class they wish to attend.
Another important action would be to ask the user for their contact details which would save their spot and assist
identification. The task would be create a program which would take their name and email, thereby registering the client.
