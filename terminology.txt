Homework: Lesson 7 – Git & GitHub terminology

GIT WORKFLOW FUNDAMENTALS
• Working Directory- This refers to the folder in which the files a user a currently working on are stored. This can be identified by a file path.
• Staging Area- This a middle stage between a working directory and a repository. It holds changes that have been added by the user but are not yet ready to be committed to the repository.
• Local Repo (head)- this a storage area held on the user’s local desktop (usually). It contains the files they will have created/modified but have not been shared elsewhere.
• Remote repo (master)- a remote repository stores files that have been pushed from a user’s local repo to a host (e.g., GitHub), whether it is for collaboration purposes, portfolios etc.

WORKING DIRECTORY STATES:
• Staged- staged files are ones that have been added by the user but are yet to be committed.
• Modified- modified files are ones that have been edited/altered by a user since a prior commit.
• Committed- committed files are those that have been in the staging area and now stored in the user’s local repository.

GIT COMMANDS:
• Git add- this command adds files a user has been revising to a staging area.
• Git commit- this command moves the files held in the staging area to the local repo.
• Git push- this command sends files from a local rep to a remote repo.
• Git fetch- this command retrieves information from a project stored in a remote repo without merging them with the user’s local repo.
• Git merge- this command combines two branches. For example, a user may have experimented on another branch and, once satisfied with their work, may merge this to the master branch.
• Git pull- this command retrieves information from a project stored in a remote repo and updates the local repo to update it to the project’s most recent status.
