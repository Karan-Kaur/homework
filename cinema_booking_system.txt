1) Design a cinema booking system
Dependent on the idea that the system operates for singular cinema (not a chain with theatres in different locations)

Key requirements:
- Displays the movies that are currently in cinema
- Allow a user to pick a movie, the date, and the time slot.
- A user could pick a movie and see the associated dates and time slots OR pick a date and the movies showing that day should show up.
- Displays the time slots for showings of a given movie
- Displays availability of seats- if theatre's fully booked, will not be able to confirm booking for that time.
- Takes user's details (email address and name at the minimum) so they receive confirmation of their booking and ticket.
- Take credit card details of the user.
- Could ensure the user is selecting age appropriate films? i.e. minors selected movies rated below 18/R.
- An option to cancel or ammend booking
- Selection of tickets and fees- single, group, family (e.g. if family ticket = 4 ppl, ensure 4 seats are confirmed booked)
- Potential selections- languages, 2D/3D, non-flash etc.

Potential problems:
- Ensuring the seats are not double booked for a given movie slot.
- Ensuring the dates line up with the timeframe the movie is available for- e.g. if a movie will no longer be in cinema
  by a certain month, make sure it is no longer displayed as an available option by then.
- Handling traffic when a movie is first released?- the first week/weekend of a movie's release is likely to be the busiest- ensure the system is built
  for a larger amount of users, esp. for this period.
  - May lag more during these times as the bookings are quickly taken up and availability constantly checked
- Prevent children from viewing films rated 18/R- i.e. family tickets should not be an available option for these movies. Warning should be issued about the need for ID.
- Limiting the number of tickets that can be bought

Tools:
- Web UI wireframe- early idea for layout of the booking system
- SQL database storing the movies, bookings made, available seats
- Flask- assist in developing the web application
- Python:
  MySQL connector and configuration details to link up to the DB.
  A script containing the code for get and put requests- to retrieve data about movie slots, available seats etc and to put confirmed bookings into the DB.
  User interface- asking user to select the movie, input dates, select the time slot and confirm by giving their email address/contact details
- Link to payment systems e.g. paypal, banks
